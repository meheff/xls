# XLS Talks

* 2024-03-11:
  [XLS @ UCSC Agile HW Design (CSE228A Winter 2024)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOJ8QWuEec8&list=PLfrN7RIcMe6g2LBRJLTHTdhyj5s8ag0Rg&index=27)

  In this talk we:

  * Create some XLS-generated hardware & tests interactively in a colab
    environment! All of XLS is Apache2 Licensed OSS!
  * Cover from basic to more advanced examples using our Rust-inspired
    (expression-oriented, immutable, communicating-process) dataflow DSL
  * Discuss the possibility space of ways to express and generate hardware,
    and where XLS falls in that space
  * Touch on how we've learned lessons from the past travails of HLS
  * And show a whole bunch of other goodies...

* 2022-03-01: [XLS @ LATTE'22](https://bit.ly/xls-latte): note that this is a
  keynote talk and so spans a bunch of projects, vs being XLS-specific.

* 2021-10-13: [XLS @ CROSS'21](https://bit.ly/xls-cross-21)

* 2020-10-15: [XLS @ CROSS'20](https://bit.ly/xls-cross)
