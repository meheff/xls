Utilities for working with designs placed onto the ICE40 FPGA; e.g. via yosys.

## Disclaimer

The ice40 utilities are primarily maintained by their original contributor. They
live in the XLS repository to better leverage common infrastructure.

The core XLS authors do not expect to maintain these utilities outside of a
best-effort basis, but contributions are welcome!
