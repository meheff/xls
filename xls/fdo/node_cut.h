// A cut C of node n is a set of nodes, called leaves, such that:
//    1. Each path from any primary input (PI) of the DAG (Directed Acyclic
//       Graph) to n passes through a leaf.
//    2. For each leaf, there is a path from an input to n passing through the
//       leaf and not through any other leaf.
// Node n is called the root of C. Naturally, A trivial cut of node n is the cut
// {n} composed of the node itself. A non-trivial cut is said to "cover" all the
// nodes found on the paths from the leaves to the root, including the root but
// excluding the leaves.
//
// Essentially, the concept of "leaf" should be corresponding to "value" in
// compilers. However, in the context of our IR, a "value" is equal to a "node"
// because every node defines either one or zero value. Therefore, we use "node"
// to represent leaves.
