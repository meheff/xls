// This is a very "implementation oriented" test.
//
// It is a contrived set of module-level constructs that:
// 1. Forces constexpr evaluation towards the top of the module.
// 2. Forces the use of type information lower in the file.
// 3. Uses the bindings made lower in the file in the test.
//
// 1 and 2 cause us to make sure constexpr eval doesn't continue to try to
// evaluate top-level module constructs past the point that constexpr eval was
// triggered, even if we rely on the interpreter to evaluate the constexprs, and
// the interpreter generally wants top-level bindings for the module.
//
// 3 makes sure that, even though the constexpr evaluation terminates the module
// scope evaluation early, eventually we evaluate the rest of the constructs and
// put them into the module-level bindings, and they can be used from
// functions/tests as expected.

const MY_CONST = u32:42;
type MyBits = bits[MY_CONST]; // This name reference forces constexpr eval.

struct Simple {
  x: u32
}
const SIMPLE = Simple{ x: u32:2 };
// The struct access requires type information, but we forced constexpr eval
// higher up in the file.
const TWO = SIMPLE.x;

fn main() -> (u32, bits[42]) {
  (TWO, MyBits:0)
